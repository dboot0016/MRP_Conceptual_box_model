There are four different folders. 
1. The first folder contains Matlab scripts used to analyse the CESM data, which is available upon requisition. 
2. The second folder contains data. These include: (1) freshwater and heat fluxes used to force the model; (2) Results for the runs including noise (both cases MKL and PFB); and (3) Results from regular runs. 
3. The third folder contains all the model scripts written in Matlab. 
4. The fourth folder contains the scripts to make the figures using the data from folder 2.
